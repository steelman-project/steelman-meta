# Container setup script for scaffold unattended execution.
#
# Builds from .devcontainer/ using Anthropic's reference devcontainer
# with scaffold-specific additions (Python, pyyaml, entrypoint wrapper).
#
# The container includes a firewall (init-firewall.sh) that restricts
# outbound network access to whitelisted domains only. The firewall is
# best-effort network hygiene, not a hard security boundary.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/container-setup.sh [build|setup|run|shell]
#
# Commands:
#   build   Build the container image (default)
#   setup   Build and open an interactive shell for claude login (no API key required)
#   run     Build and run the phase loop
#   shell   Build and open an interactive shell
#
# Authentication (pick one):
#   Option A — API key (pay-per-token):
#     ANTHROPIC_API_KEY   Set this env var before running 'run' or 'shell'
#
#   Option B — Claude Code subscription (flat-rate):
#     1. Run 'setup' and execute 'claude login' inside the container
#     2. Run 'run' or 'shell' without ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
#     Credentials persist in a named Docker volume between runs.
#
# Environment:
#   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY   Optional — API key for pay-per-token auth
#   MAX_ITERATIONS      Phase loop iteration limit (default: 50)
#   IMAGE_NAME          Docker image name (default: scaffold-runner)
#   CLAUDE_VOLUME       Named volume for ~/.claude credentials (default: scaffold-claude-config)
#   GIT_USER_NAME       Git author name (default: Scaffold Runner)
#   GIT_USER_EMAIL      Git author email (default: scaffold-runner@localhost)
#   SKIP_PLAYWRIGHT_MCP Set to 1 to skip Playwright MCP injection (default: inject)
#   PLAYWRIGHT_MCP_VERSION  Override @playwright/mcp version for builds (default: in Dockerfile)
#
# Rootless Docker support:
#   PHASEKIT_ROOTLESS_DOCKER  Set to 1 to run the container as UID 0 (container
#                             root). Under rootless Docker this maps back to the
#                             unprivileged host user, so files written to the
#                             bind-mounted /workspace are owned by that host user
#                             instead of an unmapped subordinate UID. Fixes
#                             "Permission denied" on /workspace under rootless.
#   PHASEKIT_CONTAINER_USER   Lower-level override for the container user passed
#                             to `docker run --user`. Accepts "root" or a raw
#                             "uid:gid" (e.g. "1001:1001"). Takes precedence over
#                             PHASEKIT_ROOTLESS_DOCKER. Default: unset (image's
#                             built-in non-root `node` user, UID 1000).

# Resolve the container user (see header docs).
#
# The image normally runs as the non-root `node` user (UID 1000). That is the
# right default under standard ("rootful") Docker, where container UID 1000 ==
# host UID 1000. But under *rootless* Docker the daemon runs in a user
# namespace: container UID 1000 maps to a high subordinate UID on the host that
# the launching user cannot chown/modify. Files the container writes into the
# bind-mounted /workspace then appear owned by that unmapped UID, producing
# errors like "Permission denied" on .claude/settings.local.json or
# artifacts/logs that even `chmod -R a+rwX` can't fully repair.
#
# Running as container root (UID 0) sidesteps this: under rootless Docker,
# container UID 0 maps back to the unprivileged *host* user who started the
# daemon, so /workspace writes are owned by that host user. The rootless
# security boundary is preserved — "root" here is not real host root.
#
# PHASEKIT_CONTAINER_USER (explicit) wins over the PHASEKIT_ROOTLESS_DOCKER=1
# convenience flag, which is just shorthand for PHASEKIT_CONTAINER_USER=root.
