# Pre-commit verification gate for the autonomous loop.
#
# scripts/run-until-done.sh runs this script before creating any phase commit
# (whether or not AUTO_PUSH is enabled). A non-zero exit blocks the commit:
#   - the wrapper writes artifacts/phase-verify-failed.json
#   - the next iteration's CONTINUE_PROMPT prioritizes fixing the failure
#     before any new phase work
#
# Goals:
#   - Catch the cheap, embarrassing class of CI failures locally
#     (lint, typecheck, broken unit tests, formatter drift)
#   - Stay FAST. This runs every iteration. Aim for under ~30 seconds.
#   - Do NOT run full E2E or integration here — those belong to the
#     verification-sprint gate (docs/QUALITY_GATES.md), which Claude
#     drives at phase boundaries with cumulative risk.
#
# Environment overrides (advanced):
#   PHASEKIT_VERIFY_CMD="..."  Replace this script with a one-shot command.
#   VERIFY_SKIP=1              Skip verify entirely for this iteration
#                              (use sparingly — e.g. docs-only phases or
#                              TDD phases that intentionally commit red).
