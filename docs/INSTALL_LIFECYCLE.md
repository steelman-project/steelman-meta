# Install Lifecycle

This document describes how scaffold capabilities are installed into a downstream project, how to detect drift, how to upgrade, and how to uninstall cleanly. The contract is implemented in `scripts/enrich-project.py` and is governed by Phase M9 of the scaffold (`docs/META_PHASES.md`).

## TL;DR

```bash
# One-time: install phasekit (canonical clone + venv + `phasekit` shim on PATH)
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/porkchop/phasekit/master/install.sh | bash

# From inside a project (verbs act on the current directory):
phasekit bootstrap          # first-time install (greenfield)
phasekit adopt              # adopt an existing project (no overwrites)
phasekit status             # current phase state (derived from workflow artifacts)
phasekit check              # audit current state against the recorded manifest
phasekit check-version      # is a newer scaffold release available?
phasekit upgrade            # re-provision against the current scaffold
phasekit channel            # show/set the self-update channel (stable|edge|<ref>)
phasekit self-update        # move the phasekit install along its channel

# Raw-flag forms still work (and can target a path), e.g.:
phasekit --reconcile .      # rebuild the manifest from disk (pre-M9 projects)
phasekit --migrate-only .   # migrate the manifest schema forward, no other effects
```

## The canonical clone (source of truth)

`install.sh` clones phasekit to `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/phasekit` and writes a `phasekit` launcher to `~/.local/bin` that runs the engine from that clone (under an isolated venv). Because `enrich-project.py` reads every scaffold source relative to its own location, **that clone is the single source for both running and upgrading any project** — you `cd` into a project and run a verb. `phasekit self-update` (or re-running the installer) moves the clone along its channel (see below). A project's own vendored `scripts/` are loop runtime, not the upgrade source.

### Update channels (stable / edge)

The clone follows a **channel** that decides which ref `self-update` moves it to (full rationale in `docs/adr/ADR-0002-self-update-channels.md`):

- **`stable`** (default) — the latest `v*` release tag. Recommended for projects that consume phasekit; reproducible and reviewed.
- **`edge`** — the tip of the default branch (`origin/master`). For developing phasekit itself or riding fixes before a release. **Opt-in and loud:** `self-update` prints an "unreleased" warning, because `edge` means `phasekit upgrade` can provision pre-release scaffold into downstream projects.
- **`<ref>`** — an explicit pin to a tag or sha; does not auto-advance.

```bash
phasekit channel            # print the current channel (default: stable)
phasekit channel edge       # follow origin/master from now on
phasekit channel stable     # back to release tags
phasekit self-update        # apply the current channel
```

The channel is persisted in `<clone>/.phasekit-channel` and is the single source of truth shared by `self-update` and `install.sh`. The installer also sets it from `PHASEKIT_REF`: the default branch → `edge`, a release tag → `stable`, anything else → a pin. With no `PHASEKIT_REF`, re-running the installer follows the persisted channel. Existing installs with no channel file default to `stable`, so behavior is unchanged until you opt in.

> Note: `phasekit check-version` is not yet channel-aware — on `edge` it still reports against release tags. Tracked as a fast-follow in ADR-0002.

## Provenance: `.scaffold/manifest.json`

After every successful enrichment, the engine writes `.scaffold/manifest.json` in the downstream project. **This file MUST be committed to the project's git history** (not gitignored). The engine warns if it is gitignored.

The manifest records:

- `schema_version` — integer; the engine migrates older manifests in-memory before any operation
- `scaffold_version` and `scaffold_commit` — what version of the scaffold installed this state. `scaffold_version` is `git describe --tags --always --dirty` (e.g. `v0.1.0`, `v0.1.0-3-g0d9ee74`), falling back to the short commit when untagged. See `docs/RELEASING.md`.
- `origin_url` — the scaffold repo's `origin` remote, so a project can find its upstream for `--check-version` and the loop update nudge (may be `null` on older manifests)
- `profile` — which profile was active (`default`, `game-project`, etc.)
- `enriched_at` — UTC ISO-8601 timestamp
- `normalization` — the recipe used for content hashing (`lf-trim-trailing-ws-single-final-newline` v1)
- `files` — one entry per scaffold-installed path:
  - `path`, `ownership`, `text` (binary or text)
  - `sha256` (normalized) and `sha256_strict` (byte-exact)
  - `overlays: []` (reserved for M9.4)
  - `installed_at` (UTC)
  - For `bootstrap-with-template-tracking`: `rendered_from` and `template_sha`

## What to commit (and what to gitignore)

Phasekit installs files and produces runtime artifacts. Most of what it installs is project-shared (commit it); a few specific paths are runtime-only or per-user (gitignore them).

### Always commit

Everything the scaffold installs into the project, plus everything the workflow produces:

- **All scaffold-installed files** — `.claude/agents/`, `.claude/hooks/`, `.claude/skills/`, `.claude/settings.json`, `.claude/CLAUDE.md`, `docs/*.md` (both scaffold-canonical and rendered project docs), `scripts/run-phase.sh`, `scripts/run-until-done.sh`, `CONTINUE_PROMPT.txt`, `AGENTS.md`, `.devcontainer/*`, `scripts/container-setup.sh`, `scripts/verify-container.sh`. These define the project's workflow contract and must be shared with the team.
- **`.scaffold/manifest.json`** — the provenance record. **Must** be committed (engine warns when gitignored). This is how `--check` and `--upgrade` know what scaffold version installed what.
- **`artifacts/phase-approval.json`** — the gate every phase ends with.
- **`artifacts/decision-memo.md`** and any `artifacts/*.md` review documents (red-team reviews, code reviews) — the audit trail.
- **`artifacts/phase-blocked.json`** when present — surfaces blockers for the next session.
- **`artifacts/project-complete.json`** when present — final completion artifact.
- **`docs/adr/ADR-NNNN-*.md`** — your project's architectural decision records.
- **`docs/DESIGN.md`** if the `with-design` profile is active — the steady-state design (M10).

### Always gitignore

These are runtime-only or per-user artifacts:

- **`.claude/settings.local.json`** — per-user overrides (often permissive); not project-shared.
- **`.scaffold/manifest.json.lock`** — fcntl.flock advisory lockfile; runtime-only.
- **`*.scaffold-tmp`** — orphan temp files from atomic copy interrupts; swept by the engine on next run, but might briefly exist.

### Copy-pasteable `.gitignore` snippet

If your project doesn't already have these entries, append:

```gitignore
# Phasekit — per-user and runtime-only artifacts
.claude/settings.local.json
.scaffold/manifest.json.lock
*.scaffold-tmp
```

Project-language gitignores (`node_modules/`, `.venv/`, build outputs, etc.) are the project's concern and aren't covered by phasekit. Keep them in your existing `.gitignore` alongside the snippet above.

### Notes

- **`AGENTS.md` at project root** is rendered with your project name and is `bootstrap-with-template-tracking` — write your project-specific guidance into it; future template improvements surface as advisory drift via `--check --include-templates`, never auto-overwriting your edits.
- **`docs/SPEC.md`, `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, `docs/PHASES.md`, `docs/PROD_REQUIREMENTS.md`** are `bootstrap-frozen` — written once, never re-rendered. Customize freely.
- **`.claude/agents/<name>.md`** files are `scaffold` class — you can extend them with project-specific rules (use `--keep-local` on `--upgrade` to preserve those edits until M9.4 ships overlay support).
- **`artifacts/`** as a directory should always exist (the engine creates it during enrichment) but its contents accumulate over time as phases land. Each artifact you commit is a piece of the project's audit trail.

## Ownership classes (M9 §2)

| Class | Behavior on upgrade |
|---|---|
| `scaffold` | Re-enrichment overwrites after acknowledged drift; default upgrade target |
| `bootstrap-frozen` | Never re-rendered, never re-checked under `--check --strict` |
| `bootstrap-with-template-tracking` | Never auto-overwritten; manifest stores `template_sha`; advisory drift when source template changes |
| `scaffold-template` | Lives only in the scaffold (`templates/`); rendered into downstream files |
| `scaffold-internal` | Lives only in the scaffold; never installable |
| `scaffold-orphan` | Downstream-only; assigned by `--upgrade` when the new scaffold no longer declares a previously-tracked path. Left on disk; `--uninstall` removes. |

See `docs/CAPABILITY_MANIFEST.md` for the full schema and per-class semantics.

## Worked example: detecting and resolving drift

A team enriched a project with the `default` profile. Months later, they want to verify nothing has drifted from the canonical scaffold version.

```bash
$ python3 enrich-project.py --check ~/projects/myapp
--check: scaffold v0.1.0
  clean: 26
  drifted: 1
  missing: 0
  DRIFT: docs/QUALITY_GATES.md  (scaffold)
```

Exit code is `3` (drift detected). The team has three options:

1. **Take the scaffold's version** (e.g. their hand-edits were a mistake): re-enrich with `--force`, or wait for `--upgrade --take-new` (Slice C).
2. **Keep their local edits**: do nothing; the drift will continue surfacing on every `--check` until they either revert or run `--reconcile` to snapshot the current state as the new manifest baseline.
3. **Reconcile**: run `--reconcile --force` to record the current on-disk state as authoritative. Use this when the drift represents intentional project-specific work that should be tracked locally rather than reverted.

## Worked example: retrofitting an existing project

A project was enriched before M9 and has no `.scaffold/manifest.json`. To bring it under the lifecycle contract:

```bash
$ python3 enrich-project.py --reconcile ~/projects/myapp
--reconcile: 27 files found on disk, 0 missing
Manifest written: ~/projects/myapp/.scaffold/manifest.json
```

After this, `--check` works normally, and future scaffold upgrades can be planned against the recorded baseline.

## Worked example: upgrading to a new schema version

When the scaffold ships a new manifest schema (e.g. v1 → v2 in the future):

```bash
$ python3 enrich-project.py --check ~/projects/myapp
--check: ... runs cleanly even on a v1 manifest; the engine migrates in memory.

$ python3 enrich-project.py --migrate-only ~/projects/myapp
Migrated manifest from schema v1 to v2.
```

`--migrate-only` rewrites the on-disk manifest without other side effects. Migrations are linear-chain pure functions in `scripts/migrations/`; the engine composes them in order.

## Best practice: always `--upgrade --dry-run` first

`--upgrade --yes` is convenient but it auto-takes scaffold-new for any file in the **`update-available`** state — i.e., the file matches the manifest sha (clean from the manifest's perspective) but the scaffold has a newer canonical version. This is correct as a default for files the team has not customized.

The trap: when a downstream project has customizations that pre-date the manifest baseline (e.g. agent files extended with project-specific rules before `--reconcile` snapshotted them), those files appear `update-available` rather than `drifted`. The default action overwrites them silently.

**The discipline:**

```bash
# 1. See the plan first; never apply blind
python3 enrich-project.py --upgrade --dry-run ~/projects/myapp

# 2. Identify any files in [take-new] that you have customized
#    (project-specific agent rules, hand-edits to bootstrap-* files,
#    anything you intentionally diverged from canonical scaffold)

# 3. Re-run with explicit --keep-local for each of those files
python3 enrich-project.py --upgrade --yes \
    --keep-local .claude/agents/code-reviewer.md \
    --keep-local .claude/agents/qa-playwright.md \
    ~/projects/myapp
```

If a project genuinely has no customizations, `--upgrade --yes` without flags is fine. The risk scales with how heavily the project has extended scaffold-installed files. Until **M9.4 (subagent overlay mechanism)** ships — which lets customizations live alongside scaffold updates without per-file flag handling — this dry-run-first discipline is the working stop-gap.

A quick way to inventory likely-customized files: run `python3 enrich-project.py --check ~/projects/myapp` first. Anything reported as `DRIFT:` is a definite candidate for `--keep-local`. The trickier cases are files in `update-available` (clean against manifest, behind canonical) — those don't surface in `--check`, only in `--upgrade --dry-run`.

## Reserved conventions

These are reserved by M9 for future sub-phases. Do not use them yet:

- **`overlays: []`** per file entry — M9.4 will populate with overlay metadata enabling append-only project-specific extensions to subagent files.
- **`*.project.md`** files alongside `.claude/agents/<name>.md` — M9.4 will introduce concat semantics so customizations survive scaffold upgrades.

In M9, agent customizations show up as drift. Use `--check` to inventory them; manual merge for now.

## Concurrency and locking

The engine takes a per-target advisory lock (`fcntl.flock` on `.scaffold/manifest.json.lock`) before any mutating operation. Concurrent runs against the same target are rejected with exit code `2`.

For CI environments that have their own mutual exclusion, pass `--no-lock` to bypass the engine's lock.

The lock is per-target-directory, never per-scaffold-repo. Concurrent enrichment of *different* targets is fully supported.

## Things M9 does NOT yet do

These are deferred to later sub-phases:

- `--upgrade` with plan-then-confirm and `--keep-local`/`--take-new` per-file overrides — **Slice C**
- `--uninstall` with `--include-once` and an uninstall log — **Slice C**
- Per-file atomic copy via `<dest>.scaffold-tmp` + `os.replace` for downstream files — **Slice C** (manifest writes are already atomic)
- Pre-install secrets regex scan (`AKIA*`, `BEGIN PRIVATE KEY`, `xox*`, real `sk-ant-*`) — **Slice C**
- Symlink refusal (refuse when target subdir realpath escapes the target) — **Slice C**
- Subagent overlay mechanism (`*.project.md` concat with conflict resolution) — **M9.4**
- Manifest signing / tamper detection — **M9.5**
- Multi-profile additive installs — **M9.6**

## Troubleshooting

**`No .scaffold/manifest.json in <target>`** — This project was enriched before M9. Run `--reconcile` to build a retroactive manifest.

**Exit code 2 with "another enrich-project.py process is operating on..."** — The lock is held by a concurrent run. Wait for it, or use `--no-lock` if you have your own mutex.

**`--check` exits 3 on a file you intentionally edited** — That's the drift detection working. Either revert your edits, or run `--reconcile --force` to record the current state as the new baseline. A future `--upgrade --keep-local <path>` (Slice C) will let you preserve edits while still pulling in scaffold updates elsewhere.

**Manifest is committed but `git status` shows it changed after every enrich** — Expected. The `enriched_at` and per-file `installed_at` timestamps update on every run. If this churn is undesirable in your workflow, `--check` is the read-only alternative.

**`--upgrade` interrupted partway (disk full, SIGTERM, etc.)** — Files that were successfully copied are scaffold-canonical on disk; the manifest, written last, may still record pre-upgrade shas for them. A subsequent `--check` will report drift on those files even though they match the scaffold. Recovery: re-run `--upgrade --yes` (or with the same per-file flags). The second pass sees clean files and is a no-op for them; any tmp files from the interrupt are swept by the orphan sweep at engine startup.
